# CPP
This repo is meant to show my progress with C++. A bunch of internships that I'm interested in require C++ knowledge, so I figured I should start hard grinding it.

## Timeline
Repository created: February 24th, 2022
  -> some little projects here an there
Started Advent of Code (2018): February 26th, 2022
  -> I have definitely learned the most from this. Having actually tedious logic problems at my disposal have been extremely helpful for learning.

## Community
Shameless plug, but I do have a discord if you're interested. I use the channel '#foshes-shit' as a sort of blog, talking about code and sharing little bits of my life.

## Sources
I haven't been alone when learning. Some sites that I frequently use to look up data structure methods:
  - StackOverflow - random questions
  - [CPlusPlus.com](https://www.cplusplus.com)

## Notices
I likely will not go through and document the Advent of Code heavily. That's sort of just been a practice for me, rather than preparing it for people to look at. All of the projects will be heavily documented, soooo yeah. Derp
